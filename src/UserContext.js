// Creates a Context object
// A context object as the name states is a data type of an object that can be used to store information that can be shared to other components within the app
// The context object is a different approach to passing information between components and allows easier access by avoiding the use of prop-drilling
const UserContext = React.createContext();

// The "Provider" component allows other components to consume/use the context object and supply the necessary information needed to the context object
export const UserProvider = UserContext.Provider;
